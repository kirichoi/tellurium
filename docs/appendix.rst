Source Code Repositories
========================

Tellurium is a collection of Python packages developed inside and outside our group, including simulators, libraries for reading and writing standards like SBML and SED-ML, and various utilities (e.g. `sbml2matlab <https://github.com/stanleygu/sbml2matlab>`_). Tellurium itself is a Python module that provides integration between these various subpackages and its source code is `hosted on GitHub <https://github.com/sys-bio/tellurium>`_. A list of constituent packages and repositories is given below:

* `tellurium <https://github.com/sys-bio/tellurium>`_: This project.
* `libroadrunner <https://github.com/sys-bio/roadrunner>`_: SBML ODE / stochastic simulator.
* `antimony <http://antimony.sourceforge.net/>`_: A human-readable representation of SBML.
* `phrasedml <http://phrasedml.sourceforge.net/>`_: A human-readable representation of SED-ML.
* `libcombine <https://github.com/sbmlteam/libCombine>`_: A library for reading/writing COMBINE archives.
* `sbml2matlab <https://github.com/stanleygu/sbml2matlab>`_: A utility for converting SBML models to MATLAB ODE simulations.
* `simplesbml <http://sys-bio.github.io/simplesbml/>`_: A utility for creating SBML models without the complexity of libSBML.
* `libsbml <https://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml>`_: A library for reading/writing `SBML <http://sbml.org/Main_Page>`_.
* `libsedml <https://github.com/fbergmann/libSEDML>`_: A library for reading/writing SED-ML.
